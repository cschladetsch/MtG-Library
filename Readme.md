# MtG Library Helper

This project intends to assist with the automation of generating deck descriptions for Magic the Gathering (MtG) trading card game.

## Creating an Inventory

The first thing you want to do is make sure you have an accurate record of the cards that you possess.

This record should be stored in a way that is able to be consumed by other MtG online services liked [TappedOut](http://www.tappedout.com).

Making this inventory is tedious: one must enter each card name and add other details.

The purpose of this project is to help with this task by recognising card names and other details from images taken from the webcam on your computer, or otherwise by images of your cards.

## Creating a Deck

After you have a full Inventory of all your cards, you can make *decks* which are just a subset of cards in your inventory.

It is again useful to abstract and store this in the project so decks can be modified and then later uploaded to other sites like TappedOut.

## Exporting a Deck

There are a number of simple format for MtG deck descriptions, and it is the intent to support them all.
